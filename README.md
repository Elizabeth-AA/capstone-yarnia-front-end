## BrainStation Capston Project 2023 - Elizabeth Atkinson
### to start: npm run dev

### Phase One: Welcome to the world of yarnia
#### Find inspirational projects for your special skeins
Like many knitters, I have a stockpile of special yarn. This is yarn that was gifted, bought on vacation, or is otherwise sentimental. It can be daunting to choose a project that makes the best use of the yarn. <br>
Another challenge is presented by the huge amount of information available on Ravelry. yarnia streamlines the browsing process by suggesting projects that Ravelry users have made with particular yarn. <br>
Viewing projects is useful for learning how the yarn knits up. This helps with visualizing your dream project.

### Planned for Phase Two
user auth for personal stash pages <br>
front and back end validation <br>
search using yarn colorways <br>
user added notes for stash items <br>
filter within categories <br>
display detailed project information <br>
delete stash items <br>
